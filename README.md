## 1. Change Point Detection using Time Series Analysis:
      Change point detection is a common problem in time series analysis where the goal is to identify points or intervals in a time series where the underlying data 
      distribution or behavior changes. It is a valuable technique in various fields, including finance, environmental monitoring, manufacturing, and more. There are 
      several approaches to change point detection in time series analysis, including statistical methods, Bayesian methods, and machine learning techniques.
